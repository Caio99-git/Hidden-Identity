## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate the first screen of a spy-themed party game. The screen acts as a login interface but is built purely for demonstration — it does not have interactive or backend features.

This static interface introduces the aesthetic and atmosphere of the game, serving as the entry point where players would typically begin.
